📘 Rani’s Lesson: How to Learn and Master HTML, CSS & JavaScript Basics
🧠 Why Learn These Scripts?
Learning these 60 scripts will help you:

Understand how websites work — from structure (HTML), to style (CSS), to interactivity (JavaScript).

Gain practical experience by seeing how changes affect a page instantly.

Build confidence to create your own web pages and apps.

Get ready to explore advanced topics like responsive design, animations, APIs, and even full-stack development.

🪄 How to Learn These Scripts (Step-by-Step)
1. Open the Demo Files
Start with the HTML file: ranis-html-lessons.html

Then go through CSS: ranis-css-lessons.html

And finally JavaScript: ranis-javascript-demos.html

💡 Tip: Open them in your browser to see the output, and in any code editor (like VS Code or Notepad++) to view or modify the code.

2. Read and Observe
Each script is labeled with a title and a short description.

Look at what it does visually or how it interacts with you.

Try to guess why it works before reading more.

3. Copy & Experiment
Copy the code into a new .html file.

Change something small: a color, a message, a tag.

See what happens! This is how real learning happens.

4. Practice a Script Daily
Master 1–2 scripts every day.

After 30 days, you’ll understand 60 concepts clearly.

5. Create Your Own Mini Project
Ideas:

A personal web page (using HTML)

A styled resume or profile (using CSS)

A simple quiz or calculator (using JavaScript)

6. Teach Others
The best way to master something is to explain it to someone else.

Use these scripts as your teaching material (just like you’re doing now!).
